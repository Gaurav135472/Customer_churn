bolay where i use to work at im going to leave them an honest review to trust me they probably had something to do with this so as i leave bolay boom i said well i have my kitten and she might need some fresh food so we goes to walmart right cross the street as im walking through the parking lot a black lady walk by with some orange and blue on and said you dont know how much power i got and kept walking i looked both ways as i crossed the street trying to find who she was talking to turns out nobody was their so it had to be me i ignored her and proceeded into walmart then it just started raining so i rushed into walmart as i go into walmart i was being followed from the pan handle i started noticing ppl talking about me and ppl following me i go to the fisher ale to restock on mace but when i got there it was like 9 people in football pads holding machetes not saying nothing just examining so i walk straight threw the middle of them nervous cause of what ppl are saying about me so my anxiety is kicking in at that point cause i didnt know why football players was holding machetes while everyone was walking through walmart talking mess about me so i left that ale to get away from them go to the electronics ale where im more comfortable at then next thing you know someone throws an seminoles foot ball at me witch is assault and with all this going on at this point my anxiety is about to flip out cause ppl are throwing things at me and me as a homeless aint bout to let people get use to that matter fact someone drove down the high way and throw and egg at me as i was sleep on the side walk i called the police and told him i wanted to sue them for their car he aint even take the police report and it was at least 12 cameras pointing at that spot i was sleeping in cuss thats the reason why i was sleeping their but lets keep going with the walmart story so i admit to saying a few word in my defense after seeing what i just saw on the last ale and herring what i just heard and knowing im being followed stalked and harassed by the public but ay nobody cares about a homeless mans rights so a try to keep my calm grab my bearings and walk away for the people who dont like me so i go all the way to the food ale why every time i get to this one dudes ale that works their hes bashing a wooden pallet on the ground making it sound like gun shots im looking at this boy like why are you doing that your scaring people and he only does it when i walk by so then i notice every one doing a full evacuation like its a bomb threat going on in walmart so i move with
