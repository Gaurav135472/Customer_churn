refund so that i can reorder this much needed item i am told to wait 2 weeks until they receive it back and then i can reorder they know item is damaged they know its on the way back as the shipping carrier damaged it reported it while reporting it was going back and never reached the buyer thus no chance of fraudulent return etc now i cannot reorder as money is tied up in this damaged order i wont ever receive had an issue with an order 2 weeks ago they said i would be refunded for medical equipment for my dying father and that never happened when i checked in on that promise the agent just bailed on the conversation and i chalked it up to one time issue and crappy agent but again again they left the conversation and when i called to speak directly to an agent they did the same thing told me they cannot help me at all this is a lie as i have had refunds issued in the past before they got a returned item but now they say that isnt possible i asked why this time  especially when they know 100 percent its on its way back and damaged at no fault of my own they refuse to answer do not order from amazon much safer and faster to buy locally or drive to the closest shopping

that wasnt delivered and he needed to verify my address he insisted this was the only way to verify my address was correct and to purchase a gift card for verification so he instructed me on how to do that after purchasing the gift card he said it didnt work and to purchase another gift card  he said the second gift card didnt work either and to try it one more time after purchasing 3 different gift cards he told me to give it 30 minutes and i should receive a link from his number 7155003956 and to follow the link they provide to get my gift cards refunded back to mei waited patiently for 30 minutes only to never hear back from him again i tried calling the numbers back and nobody answeredall 3 gift cards totaled 405 dollarsafter spending 7 days notifying amazons fraud department each day they told me i had to wait 24 to 48 hours as they investigated the fraudulent charges i then notified my bank and emailed all my emails from amazon and the screenshots i took from the scammer erasing

not in the same condition i sent it in or not receiving it back at all  i requested they send a front and back photo of the part they claim was missing and they never did i explained this to ebay and asked them to open an investigation their initial response is that a case had been opened and they may reach out to me the seller andor the buyer to provide additional details while waiting to hear the status of the investigation from ebay the next thing i know i receive an email from ebay saying they sided with the buyer and issued them a full refund and the buyer apparently also gets to keep

anonymous,2.0,1,ebay,united states,2024-08-01 20:24:38,ebay support is beyond horrible,ive been on ebay for 21 years now something they insist on pointing out every time i need to call them  as if i dont know when i joined  i need to be reminded  whytoday and this started days ago actually look at any listing usually shipping info is in a tab right next to item description   but for some time that has been missing  tried two different browsers same thingnow when i shop this is one of the important bits of info i want to see  first where is said item coming from what carrier some are worse than others worth avoiding and if its not right on the listing the costthis is missing nownote several things i do when shopping on ebay  check the feedback see where the shop is actually located and the shipping info i should not have to look at a shops about page when the very first thing i do is click us only  but you better take the time to go look at any shop you land on go to the about page and so often its china  or some other country not usa shipped from the usa but the shop is on another part of the globe   that usually means its amazon  some jerk fills orders and never even touches the item  so now i always check shop locations toothen do check feedback  i can usually tell some people are just never happy and will leave a neg  not too hard to spot those  but if you see hundreds in just the past year  negs   run away   and why are those horrible sellers even allowed to stay    ebay doesnt care thats why  today its shipping that is missing from every listingso i go around their maze to get ebay to call me  a rochelle directly from india very hard to understand  she tries has me on hold to check something but vanishes  fine  around the maze again pick from their list of reasons that does not have the actual reason argue with an auto bot finally get to the point they will call me   this time an american girl calls me very nice tries to find something out has to put me on hold at least this time the aweful hold music tells me the call is still going unlike the first one that just went dead  while on hold rochell keeps calling me but she cannot hear me so she hangs up   over and over againgees figure out your phone is broke and stop trying huh   then the one who i thought was actually helping also cuts me offnow beyond furious i go through the bot the voicemail yet again  but this time my reason for calling is answered by me literally shouting into the phone agent  human  manager  complaint    the dumb thing tells me to go to ebays website gives me the damn site as if i dont already have it and hangs up  during all this mess i figured it might be faster to just ask the seller where the thing is coming from but when i hit contact seller it seems someone already asked   so not on my end then huh   someone else already had to asklastly and this is a whole other issue many sellers on ebay are actually selling amazon   i have been told by ebay repeatedly

pointing out every time i need to call them  as if i dont know when i joined  i need to be reminded  whytoday and this started days ago actually look at any listing usually shipping info is in a tab right next to item description   but for some time that has been missing  tried two different browsers same thingnow when i shop this is one of the important bits of info i want to see  first where is said item coming from what carrier some are worse than others worth avoiding and if its not right on the listing the costthis is missing nownote several things i do when shopping on ebay  check the feedback see where the shop is actually located and the shipping info i should not have to look at a shops about page when the very first thing i do is click us only  but you better take the time to go look at any shop you land on go to the about page and so often its china  or some other country not usa shipped from the usa but the shop is on another part of the globe   that usually means its amazon  some jerk fills orders and never even touches the item  so now i always check shop locations toothen do check feedback  i can usually tell some people are just never happy and will leave a neg  not too hard to spot those  but if you see hundreds in just the past year  negs   run away   and why are those horrible sellers even allowed to stay    ebay doesnt care thats why  today its shipping that is missing from every listingso i go around their maze to get ebay to call me  a rochelle directly from india very hard to understand  she tries has me on hold to check something but vanishes  fine  around the maze again pick from their list of reasons that does not have the actual reason argue with an auto bot finally get to the point they will call me   this time an american girl calls me very nice tries to find something out has to put me on hold at least this time the aweful hold music tells me the call is still going unlike the first one that just went dead  while on hold rochell keeps calling me but she cannot hear me so she hangs up   over and over againgees figure out your phone is broke and stop trying huh   then the one who i thought was actually helping also cuts me offnow beyond furious i go through the bot the voicemail yet again  but this time my reason for calling is answered by me literally shouting into the phone agent  human  manager  complaint    the dumb thing tells me to go to ebays website gives me the damn site as if i dont already have it and hangs up  during all this mess i figured it might be faster to just ask the seller where the thing is coming from but when i hit contact seller it seems someone already asked   so not on my end then huh   someone else already had to asklastly and this is a whole other issue many sellers on ebay are actually selling amazon   i have been told by ebay repeatedly this is most certainly against their tos   but do they do anything  oh hell no   in fact i started simply returning any and everything that comes in an amazon package or by an amazon truck or even has amazon coupons inside   i just send it back  but then ill leave a neg feedback saying i did not order from amazon   but so far every

play store installed it looked genuine at first but it was actually a limited chinamodified version of the firmware which prevents you from installing banking apps due to security risks on ebay this is often misleadingly labeled as an international rom making it sound better but its a scam designed to hack your phone or expose it to high risks the fake play store mimics the real icon and even

sold compared to my 2000 items over 20 years as im mostly a buyer this clearly shows that ebay tends to support vendors over buyers and the situation is rapidly worsening this could be their downfall especially with competitors like amazon around but some people will always try to save a few pounds despite the risks for instance ebay now allows very obvious fake items like a 1 terabyte usb stick

figure out who did it who was previously fired for bad work they tell me to buy the bolt somewhere then theyd reimburse me and install it but they offered no proof of this conversation of course i ask but they say that they go on memory they dont write on my computer account or put such things on paper just trust them i argue for 30mins with serviceman austin and manager paul i think of the possible problems but they insist said that he austin also managers paul and richard would remember months later i return and of course no one remembers we discuss for 20mins then they agree to it they take my car and they say theyll text me when done i walk away for almost 2 hours and come back to no one knowing where my car is then having no record of it being checked in even thought they texted me to say the work has started then after 2 hours of waiting i come back they say they didnt change the oil because they couldnt take off the bolt but for 2 hours they never contacted me to tell me then they ask me to go to another mechanic to have the bolt remove and say theyll reimburse me they then take 40mins to get approval i ask again for something in writing they say no i say at least tell what needs to be done and i can record it with my phone to tell the next mechanic service person austin says that he doesnt want his voice recorded  after 1520mins of arguing he agrees to write something instructions down on paper after several shops say they cant remove bolt without doing an oil change i find one shop who said theyd add some oil so i can drive it back to walmart or take the bolt half off i make an appt then as i am in their shop i call walmart they say that they cant do it that day so i had to make another appt at the other shop that is going to remove the bolt after the 3rd day of this i get the bolt loosened not to lose the oil so i can make it back to walmart with oil then back to walmart for more memory loss conversation but then austin asked for a higher manager sorry i forgot her name to step in after explaining the whole thing to her she said that shed reimburse me i then got the oil change and my money but this was a complete headache and waste of 3 days of my time my time waiting while no work was done my time searching and going to several repair shops to find someone to do the work my time making appointments with walmart my time

text me when done i walk away for almost 2 hours and come back to no one knowing where my car is then having no record of it being checked in even thought they texted me to say the work has started then after 2 hours of waiting i come back they say they didnt change the oil because they couldnt take off the bolt but for 2 hours they never contacted me to tell me then they ask me to go to another mechanic to have the bolt remove and say theyll reimburse me they then take 40mins to get approval i ask again for something in writing they say no i say at least tell what needs to be done and i can record it with my phone to tell the next mechanic service person austin says that he doesnt want his voice recorded  after 1520mins of arguing he agrees to write something instructions down on paper after several shops say they cant remove bolt without doing an oil change i find one shop who said theyd add some oil so i can drive it back to walmart or take the bolt half off i make an appt then as i am in their shop i call walmart they say that they cant do it that day so i had to make another appt at the other shop that is going to remove the bolt after the 3rd day of this i get the bolt loosened not to lose the oil so i can make it back to walmart with oil then back to walmart for more memory loss conversation but then austin asked for a higher manager sorry i forgot her name to step in after explaining the whole thing to her she said that shed reimburse me i then got the oil change and my money but this was a complete headache and waste of 3 days of my time my time waiting while no work was done my time searching and going to several repair shops to find someone to do the work my time making appointments with walmart my time arguing with them when they simply refuse to document their words this was the worst experience thanks to the inexcusable efforts of austin and managers paul and richard also service person lisa was quite rude to me while trying to step into conversations that she knew little details about to make excuses for walmart im surely done with walmart auto care at least that location,en,nan,

service a negative 5 stars i would they are atrocious i bought a lawn mower online and it failed to work properly so i went online to start a return since i didnt have the box for it i had the option of returning it to the store without  it i chose the glendale ave  store went in with the lawn mower gave the girl the print out of the barcode she needed to process it and before she even scanned it she told me she couldnt take it because it didnt have a box excuse 1 i said to her that walmart online said i could bring it here and you would take care of boxing it she said she got in trouble for taking a return without the box so she would call her team leader i said okay her team leader showed up devon i believe and said the same thing about not having a box so i told him again what the walmart online said so he called michelle his team coach i think who told him they could take it if it didnt have gas in it i told him the gas was run out of it he removed the gas cap and told her he could smell gas i said of course you do its a gas tank duh he walked off on his walkie talkie and came right back saying that michelle said bring it back when you get the gas out of it excuse 2 then another guy walks up takes the gas cap off and says you need to take it home and clean that out and bring it back unsolicited excuse from the peanut gallery by this time all i wanted to do was talk to michelle so thats what i said to them get michelle up here please they kept talking about how and why they wont take it and i just kept asking for michelle or michelles information so i can tell headquarters who she is michelle told them that she was busy and wasnt coming i got on the phone after that and called the headquarters about everything that just took place and was out in the parking lot on the phone with them after about 2025 minutes michelle shows up i had headquarters on the phone still and went to talk to her she said she came out and looked at the mower and would have taken it back but security wont let you back in the storewaitwhat i went through the whole scenerio with her about all the bad excuses i was given only to be told that you were too busy to address the situation yourself and now to find out that i am not allowed in the store because of your employees bad service it was astounding i couldnt believe what i just went through with them the woman on the

look at them and they informed us the serial number on the box and on the airpods match but when you connect them to the device the serial number is different they guessed someone switched it that works at best buy or at the factory in vietnam although they can see we were scammed they told us theres nothing they can do as its 6 days outside the return window and we need to call apple apple said it has to be brought in and the nearest apple store is 2 hours away one way what a racket they sell counterfeit headphones as new and original and then refuse to help and do nothing even when they can see and admit they delivered a counterfeit product ive gone ahead and attached photos of the two serial numbers of what it should be based on the receipt and what it is when connected ive been a best buy customer for over 20 years and a card holder since 2011 and am insanely disappointed in them ive never complained or had issues and have spend thousands on appliances and tvs and apple products but this is nuts they sell counterfeit goods and dont help im a best buy customer no more and card is on the way to the trash also the geek squad took my wifes unlocked phone to the back room out of our sight to check on these headphones you should never take someones unlocked phone to a back room it should be done in front of you its a big security issue and they were gone with it for like 10 minutes just all around bad service by a company we were loyal to and were scammed by also after reading the reviews on apple headphones on best buy apparently this is a common scam that best buys does as theres are quite a few with the same issues or google fake airpods best buy and there are tons of forums of people they have does this to its crazy they know about it and do not do anything and if you dont catch the scam within the return window you are sol the return window shouldnt apply for counterfeit goods,en,computers & electronics,0.64

was for best buy to email me a label and return the item for a refund i wasnt happy because i now would have to shop for another baby gift and no apologies or anything were even offered but since that

to inform you that we do not have an option to honor the price match for the old price for canceled orderwhat excuse me i explain again theyve all told me differently i have evidence of your company representatives promising me this refundim truly sorry to hear about your experience and im sorry you are having to face this issue please accept our sincere apology for the inconvenience caused and incorrect information provided by previous agent as it is canceled order we do not have an option to honor the previous sale price john tells me mercilessbut it wasnt just one agent i argue i have proof they all told me the same thing so i karen i admit it i tell him let me speak to a supervisori can surely arrange for a supervisor but i want to let you know that ive thoroughly investigated all potential solutions in this situation believe me if there were any available options to provide you with refund i would have already taken care of it getting a supervisor wouldnt have been necessary since ive already explored this option on your behalf john tells meand heres the thing friends i do believe him he doesnt seem like a bad guy even though hes complicit in stealing money from me but in the words of an anachronistic anne boleyn like what was i supposed to do whats the worst thing that can happen john if i ask to speak to your manager explain it to meis it a waste of my time four months after the theft occurred to chase down 430 like some cadaver dog sniffing up and down a river after the frost melted to see if i can pick up on a trail after four months will one more conversation one more long shot really be the straw that breaks my back at worst what will happen john will i waste more company time good i hope i waste at least 430 of company time frankly i hope i waste morea supervisor is reviewing the chat logs now before they get back to me theyre a floor supervisor but they didnt provide a name pray for me friends,en,computers & electronics,0.81
