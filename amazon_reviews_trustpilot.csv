Lucy Loo,8 reviews,GB,"Friday, October 11, 2024 at 09:57:32 a.m.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Driver stealing ,As a family we order from Amazon almost daily. Sadly we've had a change in our regular delivery guy and one of the new ones is so clearly stealing packages. They log it as posted through our door and nothing is there. They've been reported to Amazon as potential theft and hopefully it will be dealt with accordingly. Unacceptable and it's now happened several times. 
Jeffrey Bruce,5 reviews,GB,"Thursday, October 10, 2024 at 05:09:02 p.m.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Amazon are quick enough to take payment…,"Amazon are quick enough to take payment for orders, but fail to deliver, but claim they have delivered which is total false claim. They have to be the worst for delivering, there customer service is no better they don’t give a dam, this company is going down hill fast use to be good, lately so poor. If you value your money don’t spend it with Amazon. "

But tell me contact manufacturer. I advise you all just started going back out to the store Amazon a complete ripoff since j. bezo left. Hiring all type of people from different countries no wonder none of our stuff is safe here. Just steady outsourcing jobs to other countries. Last time I'll shop here and anyone I know.

Ninja Ape,9 reviews,DE,"Wednesday, October 9, 2024 at 05:44:08 p.m.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Amazon is useless,"Amazon doesn't care about it's customers. The customer service couldn't care less about any issues. Their system is useless. If something goes wrong, you have to take care of it yourself and waste your time to fix something that was messed up by Amazon. Most articles sold there are available cheaper on other platforms, especially Chinese merchandise. In short, Amazon is useless, besides it's questionable business practices..."

I will say that Amazon have refunded me but, is there a problem? I’ve spent thousands of pound using Amazon but is there an issue with delivery drivers removing products and leave it up to the buyer to report with no update? Check your deliver before the courier leaves "
Da,21 reviews,GB,"Thursday, October 10, 2024 at 11:36:09 a.m.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Where is the negativity coming from?,"Probably the only store that 1) delivers on-time; 2) prices fairly and matches its competitors and 3) offer great value-for-money through Prime. It seems only upset customers leave reviews. A pity, because across their US, Dutch, UK, French and German websites I've never had an issue."
Daniel,2 reviews,US,"Thursday, October 10, 2024 at 04:17:35 a.m.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,No customer service,"No customer service, very bad designed and structured website, the worse app I ever see. The most expensive prices, they don't care about delivery date, they can extend it as much they want. A company don't follows any laws or rules, my question have this site have customers??? Seriously, I don't find one point positive here, or everyone dont know nothing, or this site cannot have sales, they are the worse on everything. This company must be shut down, it's like mafia in everything"
Peter King,8 reviews,GB,"Thursday, October 10, 2024 at 01:28:58 p.m.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Dodgy delivery information,"I have been expecting a delivery from Amazon since the 27th Sept. I was informed it could be late and should be delivered by today 10th Oct, however checking on their courier UPS site they have not received the item. It's also impossible to find out what's happening on their website. I have purchased a lot from Amazon but I'm reluctant to continue doing so. "
Mr Barry,28 reviews,IE,"Thursday, October 10, 2024 at 09:24:17 a.m.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars,I find the company to be overall in tune with customers needs,"Speaking purely as a buyer (never sold on the platform), I've found them to be responsive to customer issues and problems, not that I've had many. A few times damaged goods over many many years of using Amazon, in each case it's been resolved promptly and with minimal of fuss.I know it's a bit company and I'd like to see more competition, but I at least feel mostly confident buying items there, v something like eBay which is very mixed in terms of users and sellers, some good ones and some awful ones who sell fake goods etc.I'm mostly happy, though the recent hike to £35 for free delivery is a bit much I think (used to be £25)"

Angel Perez,6 reviews,US,"Friday, October 11, 2024 at 12:08:17 p.m.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Amazon is simply excellent,"Amazon is simply excellent. Every time I’ve made a purchase, I’ve received impeccable service. They are very serious about what they offer, and their customer service is fast and effective. I’ve had a few minor issues, and they always resolve them without complications. Plus, the punctuality of their deliveries is impressive; orders almost always arrive earlier than expected and in perfect condition. It gives me great confidence knowing that if something goes wrong, Amazon responds. In short, it's a platform that makes me feel secure when buying, and it's always my first choice."

Sarah,3 reviews,FI,"Thursday, October 10, 2024 at 04:41:26 a.m.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Worst company on planet earth,"I have bought items from Amazon a few times. Having fighted the company for refunds on damaged and returned items I only wonder: yall americans live like this? This is the most horrible company for a customer to buy from. Thank God Amazon doesn't have a monopoly in nordic countries. At least yet it doesn't.Having monopoly of the market is the only way a company this horrible stays in business. Items are packed horribly. Customer service runs customers in circles and offers nothing but empty promises. Most of the items sold on the website are utter trash.Yall if you don't need an itemn from this company to survive, it's not worth it. "

How can they not trace the form of payment to an account, and see where the items shipped to? 0 Customer Service, even when its theft over a thousand! "
YSBroly,2 reviews,GB,"Friday, October 11, 2024 at 10:16:34 a.m.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,NEVER PRE ORDER FROM AMAZON.,"NEVER PRE ORDER FROM AMAZON.I pre ordered Dragon Ball Sparking Zero all the way back in June 2024 (4 months before release day) hoping to receive it on release day (October 11th 2024) BECAUSE THATS THE WHOLE POINT OF PRE ORDERING. However, I haven’t received the game on release day and it’s looking like the “pre order” will arrive a few days late. Other people who pre ordered from GAME and Smyth Toys have already received their pre order on release day. What’s even worse, is some people got the game on release day without even pre ordering, by just going in retail store to pick it up in person. So my point is, if you guy want to pre order ANY game to get it on time, DO NOT BOTHER WITH AMAZON, but rather pre order from GAME or digital edition on the PlayStation store. No point pre ordering if you are not going to get it on time."

Used to be reliable and could get customer service. I ordered something to be delivered to my office. I always make sure I have instructions as to the hours the building is open--which do not include 4 a.m. Multiple times I've had notices that they tried to deliver and couldn't--and the hours were always before or after the building was open. Sometimes i still get the order, sometimes i don't. i definitely don't when i use my business account, which I'll never use again. And I can't get help for customer service, BECAUSE THERE IS NO CUSTOMER SERVICE!"

They keep transferring you from one person to another, seems like nobody knows what they are doing, nor how to help you !You have to repeat your issue over and over again to each new ""agents""...It's a frustrating disaster, a big company like Amazon should be ashamed about that !!"
Ale Paglia Azzimonti,1 review,IT,"Wednesday, October 9, 2024 at 10:58:33 a.m.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Extremely disappointed ,Having lived previously in California… I’ve been a fan of Amazon… until now. I’m absolutely disappointed. One week ago I purchased a Conga vacuum cleaner supposedly in “as new” condition. In the end I received a badly damaged item. I returned it and 2 days ago I placed a new order for (this time) a new one.. I learnt my lesson in Italy.. and guess what… the same damaged  item arrived… no words..

This was ordered thru Amazon. I communicated with Amazon customer service and was told they will not refund my money because they were unable to find tracking number that Kenneth Cole provided in my account in which Amazon have access to. So this is how Kenneth Cole and Jeff Beso make their billions!!! They stolen my money!!!

Fee continues to be taken after many attempts to cancel. The only way to stop it is to remove payment card. That means no purchases until everything has ceased. Prime is only suspended so if card is restored payment is taken immediately. MONEY GRABBING

I order for next day delivery and the times keep changing, keep getting put back and back and then at the last minute, at TEN PM, they say its coming tomorrow. Then when tomorrow comes we go through the same process. First it was being delivered between 2:15 and 4:15, now it is between 4:45 and 7:45. By the time 7:45 comes it will have changed yet again. I have got far better things to do than sit here all day every day!!They are also churning out the biggest load of cheap rubbish I have ever seen. Amazon has urned into the UK version of Temu. This is the LAST TIME I purchase anything from Amazon!!!!"

St. Luke's Lutheran School,1 review,US,"Tuesday, October 8, 2024 at 06:35:42 p.m.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Small SChool,I want to set a business account for a small private school and since we only have land lines they will not let me set up a business account or use my personal number since it is on my account. I think this is one of the dumbest things I've heard and customer service said that they could do nothing to help me. I guess I will buy my school supplies from venders who want to work with small schools and be helpful.

They have no running water yet, and things have been bad. I wanted  to help and placed several orders with Amazon to help them get essential items. They had began getting mail and had seen Amazon trucks in their neighborhood. I ordered over 2 weeks ago. EVERYDAY I get a delayed message. I feel so bad because items like paper towels, toilet paper and things like that are needed. I'm afraid the next thing I'll get is ""sorry but we had to cancel"". Something should have been posted saying if you are sending things to North Carolina expect delays. "

Amazon drivers are leaving the packages at the door, not even knocking or ringing the bell (I work from home so I am always at home), and going away. For this particular order that I mentioned at the beginning, they marked as ""delivered"", but it was not in front of my building, I checked with my neighbors, nothing, the package disappeared.I got a refund from Amazon, but I was expecting the item. Sometimes we need to deliver the items to other buildings on the street because they deliver on our building, but it is not ours. Very messy."
Mardoqueo Segovia,1 review,US,"Thursday, October 10, 2024 at 01:13:28 p.m.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Amazon sucks,"So I bought a keyboard piano a month ago and they sent me the wrong one. I got a toy keyboard basically, all beat up and dirt. So I proceeded to return it the next day. They said it would take up to a month for me to get a refund. When I contacted amazon a couple of days ago they said the return was stuck at the processing center or whatever. Then asked me to send them I.D. because of suspicious activity on my account and it will take 3 days for them to even CONSIDER refunding. So my last step was to ask them to sent the refund to my bank account and not my Amazon credit card (I had payed with my bank credit card) because I don't want to buy from this company anymore and they said that they cannot do that! Beware of this company and you better go buy from other companies like Sweetwater or guitar center."

I have Generally had a good experience. ,Been a prime customer for years. Have placed over 60 orders so far and most of the time I have had no problem with them. Next day delivery parcels have arrived safely at my door 90% of the time.

Clearly a template has been sent, but they have failed to swap the [Review title] and [ASIN title] for whatever the review or product is meant to be.  Similarly, their follow up where they proceeded to restrict the account fails to edit their template too, not swapping [Date] out for when the review was meant to have been left.Their links to the community guidelines dont help, as there is no way to find which guideline is meant to have been broken when they fail to provide a link to the review in question.Their support line is also useless, the response has been no help, just repeated the same cut-and-paste statements, without any attempt to actually address the issue, or just sending you round in circles to the same places you have been sent before."

I’ve been paying prime to get better delivery timing, and zip, screwed, over this last 8 months, after finishing my purchase and getting a set delivery time and date, boom!!!! They keep changing the arrival date and time. No reason no excuse. The delivery service center got no clue on how to handle customer service and on top of that, you have no access to a phone # or chat to complain, and if you do, the just answer “cancel and we give you the refund”. I want my product, don’t sell something you can provide. Amazon is frustrating and I’m getting disappointed. I think I will switch to another company "

Courier Evri but guess what 4 o’clock message from courier delivery delayed this is usual for Evri when they can’t be bothered to deliver(done this several times before). Complained to Amazon three days on trot still no items or reason as to why. One supervisor actual told me get in my car and go look for similar item I live in the sticks nearest town an hour away and no idea where to start looking. Amazon should be ashamed of service they provide.
Barb,1 review,SK,"Monday, October 7, 2024 at 10:20:08 a.m.",Rated 2 out of 5 stars,Bad experience ,"I've been ordering on Amazon for years. Digital purchases, physical items. Not much that went wrong over that period. My last order was a complete mess though. I have three cards. It won't accept any of them, says my bank had declined the payment. So I'm changing the cards, customer service says they'll place a request for the payment to go through again. I call my bank and they tell me they don't even see the request. On any of them. I needed the items a week ago. I'm seriously considering taking my business elsewhere."

Bob Gunning,3 reviews,CA,"Tuesday, October 8, 2024 at 01:51:33 p.m.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Amazon's postage guarantee is worthless,"This is a follow-up to a review that I did a month ago.  I had purchased plastic green house sheeting because the application would expose the plastic to constant sunlight.  Bought it from some company in Ontario where it turns out they do not even show up in the company registry.  Anyhow, the company doubled the order, then accepted a return, then denied that the return shipment ever arrived.  That was all fraud.  Amazon's role in this is there postage guarantee.  The company allowed the return but refused to pay the return postage.  Amazon 's guarantee is that they will cover return postage.  The postal tracking number showed that the item was delivered but Amazon, even with that tracking information, sided with the supplier of the plastic and allowed them to claim no delivery.  I am updating this now because I went to VISA's fraud department to have the purchase transaction reversed.  They did their investigation of that same tracking information, confirmed delivery, and have refunded the original purchase.  Shame on Amazon.  This was pure fraud and they are complicit in that fraud.  Don't trust Amazon and don't trust their postage guarantee.  "

They were truly astounding for years I got a prime membership around 2007 and up to 2020 they bent over backwards even beyond anything I would expect. I bought a large expensive item and the seller charged me 2x the rate charged by the manufacturer website and Amazon refunded my purchase and said not to bother returning it (it was a giant tent which no way could I get it back in the box) we’re talking $350 so tonight I contacted them about a $24 order mixup that caused me to go past the 30 days and the agent had no resources to issue a credit amazing. So Amazon yes you Bezos is in the gutter just like every other money grubbing business end up. You could have made a statement Jeff ol pal but you failed to live up to your own vision.

When ordering, they no longer tell you if a product is new or used. I ordered what I thought was a new DVD set, it arrived with only 1 dvd (the 3rd of 3 disks) and was missing the other two. A check of other titles showed the same lack of information (new or used). As I live in the country, returns are a hassle, as you have to find a UPS store, and my mileage negates any refund I might receive. Also, I couldn't give a negative review about the seller, although by this point my frustration level may have contributed to my difficulty."

Austin,8 reviews,US,"Saturday, September 28, 2024 at 12:03:26 p.m.",Rated 2 out of 5 stars,False shipping expectations ,Anyone else notice an increase in false delivery times? I've ordered multiple items for same or next day delivery only for the date/time to keep getting pushed back. I'm ordering items specifically for the rush shipping only to be let down.  Looks like consumers need to start going back to brick and morter shopping to ensure expediance.
Bob Coles,18 reviews,GB,"Thursday, October 3, 2024 at 02:41:42 p.m.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Amazon scam,I ordered and paid for an item. I received a date for delivery and tracking number. The tracking number was false and non traceable.Requested refund through Amazon but they have proved to be a waste of time. It is like dealing with a scammer no communication. Buyer be ware.

A ceiling spotlight for sale for £28.86 and now in the “Prime Big Deal” it’s available for the bargain price of £28.   A big deal saving of 86 pence.  I have bought it elsewhere for under £20"

The products I ordered yesterday were due to come first thing this morning, obviously not the same day, and now they aren’t coming until tomorrow 😡😡😡 amazon sure does want your prime money each month but they don’t come through on their written word!!!  Hopefully a better company will come along and put amazon out of business!"

George,37 reviews,GB,"Monday, September 30, 2024 at 04:32:56 p.m.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Another fail.,Another fail.Ordered item needed to finish a project and ordered because Amazon stated it would be delivered Tuesday and got confirmation it would be so arranged my schedule and moved my hospital appointment from Tuesday to Wednesday. Now I get an advice from Amazon saying the item has been dispatched and will be delivered on Wednesday when I will not be at home. Not able to change my Hospital appointment again as their offices are shut! To be honest not an unexpected failure on the part of Amazon
Anon Name,31 reviews,GB,"Thursday, October 3, 2024 at 07:32:02 a.m.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Lies and more Lies,"Ordered items for son's 21st birthday cake topper, birthday wrap, banners etc. Should have been delivered yesterday but got to late afternoon so gave them a ring. They assured me it was out for delivery and I would receive order by 10pm. Think you can guess the rest.Telephoned them this morning to be told there was an issue at the sorting office so obviously what I was told yesterday was a load of lies. Told again would receive today by 10pm.Decided to use online chat. Told me they cannot guarantee delivery today.Why mess your customers about like this? They just seem to come out with any old nonsense and basically just want to get shut of you ASAP.So left praying order will arrive today as now no time to get items for son's birthday tomorrow. I already know delivery service is abysmal but Amazon Customer Services used to be top notch and unfortunately not any more."

","Our experience today is based on leaving a customer review on the products ordered and received.  Amazon sends emails requesting we leave a review. We send or at least attempt to leave a review. We leave only truthful reviews on Amazon and it seems to they do not want our reviews on their site. Each time we answer their request for a customer review, we receive a block wall preventing a review being placed on the product we received,  no matter if the review is good or bad, Amazon refuses to accept any reviews from us. And Amazon will not tell you why, therefore prompting our complaint with today. We appreciate those taking the time to read our message today about Amazon.  "

Danielle,2 reviews,GB,"Thursday, October 3, 2024 at 06:24:25 a.m.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,DONT ORDER FROM AMAZON ,"DONT ORDER FROM AMAZON it’s convenient yes but when things go wrong they don’t care.Ordered £140 in presents that didn’t arrive (3 items) to be told they have been delivered. No footage on ring cam, no photo evidence of delivery. I’m being told it was a third party theft (no evidence whatsoever) and I have to report it to the police. 3 days prior to this I was promised a redelivery by two different people that just didn’t show up to then be told no redelivery was ever sent. Anyone I’ve spoken to has been so rude I’ve tried to phone people the leadership team were too ‘busy’ the email addresses they give on chat bounce and are wrong the way I’ve been treated is disgusting! Even when you do the police report they don’t care or help you. Shocking customer service Amazon didn’t used to be like this! "

sue e,6 reviews,GB,"Friday, October 4, 2024 at 07:52:03 a.m.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Twice in a Week faulty knock of goods ,"Twice in the past week, I have bought electronics from amazon, a mobility scooter charger, and a battery grip for a cannon camera. both were a huge disappointment. far from being fit for purpose clearly Chinese fake goods and in both cases the mobility scooter charger has been known to explode was little better than a phone or PC charger and not powerful enough to charge a scooter, and the grip had buttons that did not work and at least one incident were it actually caused damage to a camera it was used on. Amazon is aware of the reviews these products get and has yet to take any steps to remove these sellers from its site. the goods that are bought in bulk and repackaged to be sold by companies that buy them are flooding the site. Amazon is not Temu Alibaba or Wish but it is getting there. if you cannot trust a company like Amazon not to allow fake knockoffs from China onto its site and take no steps to remove them from sale it is becoming untrustworthy and failing to protect the customers that use its site. If Amazon fails to take such steps it is saying we as a company do not care. "

Only to say that I do everything I can at this point to avoid making any orders through them, and to order direct with the individual vendors. They have been dishonest and caused a huge waste of my time, time after time. If there’s a textbook example of a company causing itself to fail, amazon.com is it.  I am through with them."
Donna,15 reviews,GB,"Saturday, October 5, 2024 at 01:49:44 p.m.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Poor delivery ,Amazon delivery service is terrible. Sometimes they don’t even knock and update that they have handed the parcel to me. I’ve had to try find it. Some delivery men also leave it on my doorstep in full view and I live on a bus root.  This is not acceptable. This not all the driver though !
